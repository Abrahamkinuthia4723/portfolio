<p>There are two reasons why i want to do programming which are: </p>
<ol>
    <li id="binge">Improve my communication skills</li>
    <ul>
        <li id="item">This is because when working on coding projects with others, you usually have to communicate with people with varying goals and levels of training. Also, if you are working as part of a team responding to comments from the public such as fixing bugs in an application, it may be helpful to communicate with both your team and your customers in a clear, professional and solution-focused way </li>
    </ul>
    <li id="start">Start my own business</li>
    <ul>
        <li id="fly">For example designing and runing website for others, creating independent applications or selling training courses or one-to-one mentorships to other people who want to learn code. </li>
